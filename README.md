**Game Description**

This is a simple game where the user has to repeat a sequence of colors by clicking on the corresponding buttons. The game starts with a sequence of 1 color, and each time the user repeats the sequence correctly, a new color is added to the sequence. If the user makes a mistake, the game ends and the user has to start over.

**Gameplay**

* Press any key to start the game.
* The game will display the current level and the sequence of colors to repeat.
* Click on the buttons to repeat the sequence.
* If the user repeats the sequence correctly, the game will add a new color to the sequence and increase the level.
* If the user makes a mistake, the game will end and the user has to start over.

**Technical Details**

* The game uses JavaScript and HTML/CSS to create the game interface and logic.
* The game uses the jQuery library to manipulate the DOM and handle user input.
* The game uses audio files to play sounds when the user makes a mistake or completes a level.

**Code Structure**

* The code is organized into several functions:
	+ `nextSequence()`: generates a new sequence of colors and updates the game state.
	+ `checkAnswer()`: checks if the user's input matches the game pattern and updates the game state accordingly.
	+ `animatePress()`: animates the button press effect.
	+ `playSound()`: plays a sound effect.
	+ `startOver()`: resets the game state to the starting conditions.

**Known Issues**

* None known.

**Future Development**

* Add more features to the game, such as scoring or a high score list.
* Improve the game's user interface and user experience.
* Add more levels or game modes.
